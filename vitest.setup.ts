 * Runs before every test file and gives each one its own file-store directory.

 * Vitest runs test files in parallel, and several suites exercise the JSON file
 * store. Without isolation they all share `<cwd>/.fortexa`, so one file's policy
 * or wallet write lands in another file's test. Test files that need a specific
 * directory still win: their own `vi.hoisted` block runs after this setup and
 * reassigns `FORTEXA_STORE_DIR` before any store module is imported.
