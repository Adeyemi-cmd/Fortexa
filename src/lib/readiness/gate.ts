/**
 * Unified readiness gate.
 *
 * "Ready" only when ALL of these agree:
 *   - migration:    the applied database migration id is the expected one
 *   - policy_store: the policy store loads (and is not empty)
 *   - network:      the configured Stellar passphrase is the one this
 *                   deployment expects
 *
 * Every dependency is injected so tests can stub each one. The result only
 * contains check names and pass/fail, never secrets or account ids.
