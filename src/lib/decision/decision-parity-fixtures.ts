 * Shared fixture set for issue #209.
 *
 * One fixture set is used by BOTH the live decision engine path
 * (evaluateDecision, as /api/decision calls it) and the simulation path
 * (simulatePolicyChange, as /api/policy/simulate calls it). If either path
 * special-cases a rule, the drift test fails.
 *
 * Every fixture includes the full payment comparison: asset, amount,
 * destination, and memo. Tests never build or submit a transaction — they
 * only evaluate decisions.
